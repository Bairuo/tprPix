# TPRPIX
a Cross-Platform, 2D Survival Sandbox Game Project. Based on C++17/OpenGL/SQLite3.


## Which branch should I Download
Branch:master is OK.

## Which platform is supported
Currently Win10 and MacOSX. I've only tested on Windows 10 and OSX (higher than 10.12 High Sierra). Maybe it can work in earlier versions.

## How to Installation

### Mac OS X
Make sure you have installed CMake.
Then,open your terminal, and "cd" to the target directory:

    cd .../xxx/tprPixelGames/

after that, run a shell script:

     ./osx.sh

the shell script: "tprPixelGames/osx.sh", will automatically install everything for you, which contains some directory replication work.

### Win10

## How to Play
This game support both Keyboard and most mainstream Joysticks. 
Considering it's an action game, we recommend you to use a Joystick(Xbox360-style).

### Joystick(Xbox360-Style):
- **LeftAxes** to move.

- **Button:A** to confirm. 
in game-world, you can push **Button:A** to Let the character speed up

- **Button:B/X/Y** to print some debug-infomation on terminal.

### Keyboard:
- **key:W/A/S/D** to move.
- **key:Enter** to confirm.
- **key:H/J/K/L** is mapped to **'A/B/X/Y'** in Joystick.

Once you enter the game-world, The only thing you can do is control a chicken(used for test), walk around and fly(By pressing the key: **'H'**(keyboard) or **'A'**(joystick) continuously)

Will,the remaining parts are still under development.
So, please be  patient...
